This repository documents my very first LinkedIn post about Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
I’m sharing it here to track my learning and help others starting out!

## 🧠 What is NLP?

NLP (Natural Language Processing) is how computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. With NLP, machines can:
- Read text
- Listen to speech
- Understand meaning
- Reply just like humans!

---

## 🔑 Key Terms I Learned

- **Corpus:** All the text data we use.
- **Sentences, Words, Vocabulary:** Breaking text into smaller pieces.

---

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

- Clean the text (remove punctuation, split into sentences & words)
- **Tokenization:** Break paragraphs into sentences, sentences into words.
- Useful NLTK tools:  
  `sent_tokenize`, `word_tokenize`, `TreebankWordTokenize`, `wordpunct_tokenize`

## 🔢 Turning Words into Numbers

Words need to be turned into vectors (numbers) for machine learning.
- Common methods:  
  **Bag of Words**, **TF-IDF**, **Word2Vec**, **Embedding Layer**

Now, these vectors can be used for ML training!

## 🚀 Applications of NLP

Some real-world uses:
- Chatbots
- Sentiment analysis (like on reviews)
- Text summarization
- Language translation
- Text recommendation
